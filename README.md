Communication in PHP with com
===

Inspired by the way how Android classes are communicating and embarrased of other hook mechanism, I created my own. Lightweight and performance use are important. The offical website is http://rokdd.de/permanent:php-com

Current state
===
Actually I am using the class my own and it satisfied in evey case I need. Some parts are not documented yet or are not quite perfectly. Maybe the community might not be using, even have some ideas to improve this small class.

Example
===
I created an example, which shows how it works. Just have look at controller.php
